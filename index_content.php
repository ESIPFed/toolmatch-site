<h2 class="page_title">ToolMatch: Finding Tools for Your Data & Data for Your Tools</h2>
<p>Supported by ESIPâ€™s Semantic Web cluster and funding from an ESIP Products & Services Testbed Project, the ToolMatch Service 
has been developed as a web-based service using a community-built semantic web applications to provide data users with the basic
 means to match their datasets with a comprehensive list of useful, appropriate tools, and also provide data tool developers with
 datasets or data collections that will work with their tools.  To date, most of the datasets and tools that have been included 
 in the Toolmatch service have been NASA-generated.  Our initial  interest in integrating  a data catalog (a project initiated by
 the ESIP Energy & Climate cluster known as the  Decision Support Tools Catalog and Community of Practice:  DSTCCP, fell through
 when further development of the catalog ceased, but other opportunities have arisen.    In particular, several other communities
 represented within the ESIP Federation have expressed interest in using the ToolMatch service if it can meet their needs, i.e.,
 USGS and NOAA.  These communities are especially interested in exploring the integration of data catalogs with ToolMatch.   </p>
 <p>Initially, the ToolMatch service was developed to solve two simple but prevalent use cases.  The first use case involves 
 the fact that, for a given dataset, the visualization tools that can be used to work with the dataset, (e.g., by reading,
 rendering, and mapping the data) are difficult to find.  What a user needs to do is to be able to search for the tools that
 can be used with a given dataset, and then find out what the tool can do with that dataset. </p>
<p>The second use case is a converse of the first:  for a given data tool, it can be difficult to find datasets that will work 
with the tool most appropriately, and also to find data users who can provide the feedback necessary to build comprehensive and
 sustainable frameworks and methods of access / use of a tool.  What a tool developer needs to do is to be able to search for 
 datasets that can be used with their tool, and to capture information about what the data user would like to be able to do with
their data in the shorter and longer terms.  </p>
